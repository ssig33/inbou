## A. Origin and Development of BEHIREN

1. Founding: BEHIREN (Japan "Peace for Vietnam" Committee) was organized in April 1965, nominally as a politically independent group of intellectuals and cultured persons whose purpose was "to help restore peace in Vietnam." Actually, it is a loosely organized group of ex-JCP members, progressive intellectuals, leftist cultured persons, and leftwing students - banded together in the name of opposition to the Vietnam war by two common denominators, dedicated anti-Americanism and refusal to be dominated or controlled by the orthodox Japan Communist Party.

2. Hard-Core Secretariat: The real force behind the organization of BEHIREN, right from the beginning to the present, has been a brilliant Communist named YOSHIKAWA, whose organizational skills have been perhaps the most indispensable ingredient in BEHIREN's development. YOSHIKAWA was expelled from Tokyo University for his role as a ZENGAKUREN leader in the 1960 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty riots. He then went into full-time JCP mass movement professional work, became the Secretariat officially in charge of international relations for the Japan Peace Committee. YOSHIKAWA broke with the JCP in late 1964, following the rupture in relations between the JCP and CPSU in May that year. The inspiration for BEHIREN springs in large measure from YOSHIKAWA's personal desire to use his organizational talents in countering the JCP and the Japan Peace Committee. YOSHIKAWA, in addition to being a well-qualified English linguist himself, years ago surrounded himself with a small following of similarly qualified lieutenants, whom he brought along into BEHIREN to give him the necessary depth and experience to run this new organization. YOSHIKAWA functions as BEHIREN's Secretary General.

3. Respectable Intellectual Front: Following fundamental Communist principles for mass movement work (better than the JCP itself follows those tenets), the ex-JCP organizers of BEHIREN kept themselves in the background and lined up a number of prominent Japanese progressive intellectuals and leftist cultured persons to front for BEHIREN. The choice of ODA Makoto, ex-Fulbright and popular young novelist, to be the chief front man was an extremely lucky stroke for BEHIREN. ODA has taken to this grandstanding, front work like a duck to water. It has given him a chance to give unbridled vent to his own latent anti-American feelings, puffed him up to the extent that he has been dubbed "the emperor" by other BEHIREN activists, and given him at long last an ideological mission to pursue. YOSHIKAWA has performed magnificently in feeding ODA's ego needs and in infusing and indoctrinating ODA so that his words and actions take on sufficiently virulent anti-American overtones. ODA has served another vital function for BEHIREN by recruiting a sizeable number of fellow intellectuals to join the ranks of BEHIREN activists.

4. Organizational Development: In its 2 1/2 year history, BEHIREN has appreciably changed its organizational format, although it has moved its office three times and modified its name even oftener. BEHIREN is not a "mass organization," because it has had no sizable popular backing to the present time. Its hard core, secretariat organization is run by YOSHIKAWA and his lieutenants. Its public image, intellectual front is led by ODA, and given body by a score of like-minded intellectual friends of ODA and YOSHIKAWA. The loose body of BEHIREN's activist leadership.

5. Activities and Accomplishments: BEHIREN has engaged in a number of propaganda actions, and participated in international anti-Vietnam War activities. It has tried to cooperate with certain front activists in Japan controlled by the JCP, most notably the Japan Committee to Investigate War Crimes in Vietnam activities, which culminated in the Tokyo Court of last August, but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed by the JCP. In spite of this, BEHIREN has churned along at its own pace, with a continuing series of anti-Vietnam war actions, most of them related in some way to the American pacifist movement. In this regard, BEHIREN has succeeded in cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese contacts with the U.S. pacifist movements, and has effectively capitalized on this to promote its own action program. The case of the four deserting sailors, while an apparent lucky windfall for BEHIREN, only points up the fact that BEHIREN, through past organizational work and promotional activities, was "on the spot," ready and capable (unique in Japan in this regard) to take the ball and run with it. BEHIREN ran all the way in this case and scored its most notable success since it was organized.

6. The Case of the Four Sailor Deserters and BEHIREN:  
1. How It Started: The consensus of all available overt media material, with no recorded dissent, indicates that the four sailors voluntarily left their ship, went AWOL, and ended up wallowing around Tokyo's hippie-land. Precisely what personal grievances prompted the four to embark on this mis-adventure is not yet known. But, up to this point, the four could fairly be categorized as misguided youngsters, gone astray in a foreign land, and due to get slapped back in line with traditional Navy justice when they finally decided to stop the fun and go back to the ship. So far, this made their cases far from unique.

2. How It Became an Incident: But instead of returning to their ship of their own volition or being approached by the shore patrol, the four made contact with BEHIREN leaders. Again, press reports indicate that this was just a coincidence, that there was no available overt nor covert reports that indicate otherwise. But, once the BEHIREN people made contact, they recognized the potential immediately and moved fast for the kill. 

3. BEHIREN Takes Over: When the four made contact with BEHIREN, it suddenly became an entirely different ballgame. BEHIREN had everything needed to capitalize on this: veteran activist leaders who are experienced enough to recognize the windfall that had come their way; an apparatus that could provide hiding places for the four; long-standing liaison contacts with Soviet Embassy officials for use in planning their exit from Japan; solid contacts with reliable American pacifists with whom the bona fides of the four sailors could be checked; money and organization to capitalize on the propaganda potential (such as preparing a movie film for the initial BEHIREN press conference announcing the desertion).

4. Escape to Moscow: The four deserters turned up in Moscow on 21 November. The press has speculated widely and unanimously that the four left Japan on the Soviet passenger ship Baikal on 11 November. Again, there is no dissenting opinion, overt nor covert. The only mystery concerning this final phase of the Japanese portion of this case concerns the mechanics of how the four boarded the Baikal and who assisted in this maneuver. 

5. The BEHIREN Apparatus At Work: While many of the small pieces of this puzzle, which would put the whole case in proper detailed chronological order and eliminate speculation on how the four deserters left Japan, are still missing, enough is known now, through overt and covert sources, that the picture of BEHIREN's adept handling of this case shines through clearly.

4 US Deserters Possibly Left Japan Aboard Baikal

The four deserters from the U.S. aircraft carrier Intrepid who made a dramatic television appearance Monday in Moscow are believed to have left Japan irregularly by the Soviet liner Baikal, which left Yokohama on November 11 for the Far East.

Sources in the Metropolitan Police Department said Tuesday that the four Americans could have boarded the ship by a "special gateway" for Soviet Government officials. Japanese watchmen were on guard at another gangway for ordinary passengers. When 12 American sailors boarded the liner before it departed Yokohama at 11:50 a.m. November 11, the watchmen did not notice that they did not see any persons who had boarded the ship through the ordinary gangway.

It was learned that U.S. Embassy officials in Tokyo arranged the mission in Tokyo and scores of visitors boarded Baikal through the special gateway. 

The police source said that "it would be impossible" for the four deserters to leave Japan without the U.S. Embassy's assistance. 

Yuichi YOSHIKAWA, Secretary General of the Japan Peace for Vietnam Committee (Beheiren), told a press conference Tuesday that the committee could not disclose how the four Americans left because it had promised not to do so. 

He neither affirmed nor denied the report that the Americans left Japan by the Baikal on November 11.

It was the Beheiren which announced for the first time the desertion of the four crew members of the Intrepid to press.

## SANKET (Full)

Prof. YOUNG Says Four American Deserter Seamen Not in Japan Any More

Went to Tokyo and Tried to Dissuade Them; Probably Escaped from Japan on the 12th or the 13th.

Professor Ernest P. YOUNG of Dartmouth College in the U.S., consented to an interview with this reporter on the question of the four American seamen who deserted from the U.S. aircraft carrier Intrepid. At the interview held on the 19th, Professor YOUNG clarified that the Peace for Vietnam Association (Beheiren), with Makoto ODA acting as its representative, contacted an anti-war organization in the U.S., and at this, Professor YOUNG hurriedly visited Tokyo, and meeting the four seamen in a room in an apartment house in Tokyo on the 9th and 10th, tried to persuade them to return. In regard to the press and where the four seamen are, he made the noteworthy statement that "those four were still in Japan, up until the night of the 11th, when I left Japan, but they are probably no longer in Japan now."

The questions and answers exchanged with Professor YOUNG are as follows:

1. Why did you go to Japan?  
Professor: Beheiren contacted David Dellinger, a pacifist activist in the U.S., asking him to "send someone to Japan to hear the stories of the four seamen and announce them in the U.S." I have been in Japan twice, and I also once served as special assistant to Ambassador REISCHAUER. During that time, I became friends with Beheiren representatives ODA and other intellectuals in Japan. It was for these reasons that I was given this assignment; I personally have never participated actively in the anti-Vietnam war movement so far.

2. When did you arrive in Japan, and where did you meet the four seamen?  
Professor: I arrived in Haneda on November 8, and met the four seamen on the 9th and the 10th. The place of interview was in an apartment house in Tokyo, but I cannot say at this time where that apartment house was and who owned it. However, on both days, I talked fully with these four seamen for more than three hours on each occasion (according to an investigation made by the public security authorities). Professor YOUNG arrived in Japan toward the evening of the 8th, and stayed at Hotel Tanakawa in Shiba, Minato-ku, until the morning of the 11th.

3. What were the motives for these four seamen's desertion?  
Professor: The desertion was completely the decision of these four persons. It seems that the four seamen decided not to return to the ship when the Intrepid entered Yokosuka Port on October 17, and they were permitted to go ashore for rest for one week. My impression on meeting these four seamen was that they were definitely not deserting for the purpose of self-advertisement or that they were giving false reasons. I am convinced that they deserted really out of doubt about the Vietnam war.

4. What were the movements of the four after they deserted?  
Professor: On the night of the 23rd, two days before the Intrepid was due to sail, the four went to Shinjuku, and told the people whom they met at a bar they happened to visit, that "we are fed up with war." The Japanese who heard them sympathized with them, and at one time, the four lived with some hipsters (according to this paper's
