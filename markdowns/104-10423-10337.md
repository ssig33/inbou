Mr. Hoover, I do.  
The Chairman. Mr. Rankin will carry on the examination, Mr. Director.  
Mr. Rankin. Mr. Chief Justice, do you want to tell him briefly what our purpose is?  
The Chairman. Oh, yes; it is our practice to make a brief statement before the testimony of each witness, and I will do it now.  
Mr. Hoover will be asked to testify in regard to whether Lee H. Oswald was ever an agent, directly or indirectly, or an informer or acting on behalf of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any capacity at any time, and whether he knows of any credible evidence of any conspiracy, either domestic or foreign, involved in the assassination of President Kennedy.  
What he has to say about an article in the National Enquirer, Commission Exhibit No. 837, and concerning the failure to include the name and information concerning special agent Hosty in the initial report of the Oswald arrest may have recommendations he may have concerning improvements or changes in provisions for the protection of the President of the United States. Now, Mr. Rankin, you may proceed.  
Mr. Rankin. Mr. Hoover, will you state for the record your name and position?  
Mr. Hoover. J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice.  
Mr. Rankin. Where do you live, Mr. Hoover?  
Mr. Hoover. I live at 4936 20th Place, Northwest, Washington, D.C.  
Mr. Rankin. And you have been Director of the Bureau for some 40 years according to the newspapers?  
Mr. Hoover. That is correct; since 1924.  
Mr. Rankin. You have furnished us a considerable amount of information, Mr. Hoover, about whether or not Lee Harvey Oswald was ever an agent for the Bureau in any capacity or as an informer at any time.  
Mr. Hoover. They are correct. I can most emphatically say that at no time has he ever been an employee of the Bureau in any capacity, either as an agent or as an informant.  
Mr. Rankin. I call your particular attention to Exhibit 835, and suggest that you will find that that is your letter, together with your affidavit about this subject matter, and other matters that you furnished to us concerning this particular subject.  
Mr. Hoover. That is correct.  
Mr. Rankin. Do you wish to add anything?  
Mr. Hoover. No; there is nothing that I desire to add to what appears in this letter and my affidavit which I made to the Commission.  
Mr. Rankin. You have provided many things to us in assisting the Commission in connection with this investigation and I assume, at least in a general way, you are familiar with the investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy, is that correct?  
Mr. Hoover. That is correct. When President Johnson returned to Washington he communicated with me within the first 24 hours, and asked the Bureau to pick up the investigation of the assassination because as you are aware, there is no Federal jurisdiction for such an investigation. It is not a Federal crime to kill or attack the President or the Vice President or any of the continuity of officers who would succeed to the Presidency.  
However, the President has a right to request the Bureau to make special investigations, and in this instance he asked that this investigation be made. I immediately assigned a special force headed by the special agent in charge at Dallas, Tex., to initiate the investigation, and to get all details and facts concerning it, which we obtained, and then prepared a report which we submitted to the Attorney General for transmission to the President.  
Mr. Rankin. From your study of this entire matter of the assassination and work in connection with it, do you know of any credible evidence that has ever come to your attention that there was a conspiracy either foreign or domestic involved in the assassination?  
Mr. Hoover. I know of no substantial evidence of any type that would support any contention of that character. I have read all of the requests that have come to the Bureau from this Commission, and I have read and signed all the replies that have come to the Commission.  
In addition, I have read many of the reports that our agents have made and I have been unable to find any scintilla of evidence showing any foreign conspiracy or any domestic conspiracy that culminated in the assassination of President Kennedy.  
Representative Ford. May I ask this, Mr. Hoover. As I understand your testimony, it is based on the evidence that has been accumulated thus far?  
Mr. Hoover. That is correct, sir.  
Representative Ford. Is the Federal Bureau of Investigation continuing its investigation of all possible ramifications of this assassination?  
Mr. Hoover. That is correct. We are receiving and we, I expect, will continue to receive for days or weeks to come, letters from individuals that normally would probably be in the category of what we would call crank letters in which various weird allegations are made or in which people have reported psychic vibrations. We are still running out letters of that character and in turn making a report to this Commission upon it, notwithstanding the fact that on the face of it the allegation is without any foundation. Individuals who could not have known any of the facts have made, some very strange statements.  
There have been publications and books written, the contents of which have been absurd and without a scintilla of foundation of fact. I feel, from my experience in the Bureau, that we are in constant receipt over the years of these so-called crank letters, that such allegations will be going on possibly for some years to come.  
I personally feel that any finding of the Commission will not be accepted by everybody, because there are bound to be some extremists who have very pronounced views, without any foundation for them, who will dismiss violently whatever findings the Commission makes. But I think it is essential that said that we had ignored them or that the case is closed and forgotten.  
Representative Ford. Could you give us some idea of how many agents are currently working to one degree or another on any aspects of this case?  
Mr. Hoover. I would estimate, Congressman Ford, that there are at the present time at least 50 or 60 men giving their entire time to various aspects of the investigation, because while Dallas is the office of origin, investigation is required in auxiliary offices such as Los Angeles or San Francisco and even in some foreign countries like Mexico. We have representatives in Mexico City.  
At the outset of the investigation, following the assassination, it was the desire of the President to have this report completed by the Bureau as fast as possible, and as thoroughly as possible, and I would say we had about 160 men at that time working on the report in the field, and at Washington, D.C.  
Now, all the reports that come in from the field are, of course, reviewed at Washington by the supervisor in charge of the case, and then in turn by Mr. Belmont, who is the assistant director of the division, and then in turn by Mr. Belmont, who is the assistant to the Director.  
Reports in which there is a controversial issue or where statements have been made of the existence of some particular thing that we have never heard of before, I myself go over these to see that we haven’t missed anything or haven’t had any gap in the investigation so it can be tied down.  
Recently the National Enquirer had a fantastic article in it as to the existence of a letter that had been written or a request that had been made by the Department of Justice to Chief Curry of the Dallas Police Department, to withhold arresting Ruby, or Ruby, and Oswald after the Oswald attempt on General Walker’s life.  
First, I had the agent in charge at Dallas interview Chief Curry and I have sent to the Commission a letter as to what Chief Curry had to say. He branded it as an entire lie—that he had never received any request of that kind. I had our files searched to ascertain we had not written any such letter and that they had written any such letter and Mr. Katzenbach advises there is no ref.

Mr. Rankin. I think there are certain things that you have to allow the man who is operating as a politician, and not as head of state. I mean this makes a difference in your operation.

Mr. Rowley. Yes, sir.

Mr. Rankin. And is that Commission Exhibit No. 1026?

Mr. Rowley. Yes, sir.

Mr. Rankin. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Commission Exhibit No. 1026.

The Chairman. It may be admitted.

Mr. Rankin. Do you have any additions or corrections you care to make in that exhibit?

Mr. Rowley. No, sir.

Mr. Rankin. Chief Rowley, did you give us a report about protective activity subsequent to Dallas on behalf of the Secret Service?

Mr. Rowley. Yes, sir.

Mr. Rankin. I will hand you Commission Exhibit No. 1027 and ask you if that is the report that you just referred to.

Mr. Rowley. Yes, sir.

Mr. Rankin. Chief Rowley, I ask you, are there any problems with regard to Commission Exhibit No. 1027 concerning security; and whether that should be made public? You just take your time if you want to glance over it.

Mr. Rowley. No; as I read it, it is general enough, sir, that it can be included.

Mr. Rankin. Thank you very much, Chief Rowley.

Mr. Rowley. Yes, sir.

Mr. Rankin. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Commission Exhibit No. 1027.

The Chairman. It may be admitted.

Representative Ford. Did the Central Intelligence Agency investigate any aspects of Oswald's trip to Mexico?

Mr. McCone. Yes, we did.

Representative Ford. Can you give us any information on that?

Mr. McCone. Yes; we were aware that Oswald did make a trip to Mexico City and it was our judgment that he was there in the interest of insuring transit privileges and that he made contact with the Cuban Embassy while he was there.

We do not know the precise results of his effort, but we assumed, because he returned to the United States, he was unsuccessful. We have examined to every extent we can, and using all resources available to us every aspect of his activity and we could not verify that he was there for any other purpose or that his trip to Mexico was in any way related to his later action in assassinating President Kennedy.

Representative Ford. Did the Central Intelligence Agency make any investigation of any alleged connection between Oswald and the Castro government?

Mr. McCone. Yes; we investigated that in considerable detail, because information came to us through a third party that he had carried on a rather odd discussion with Cuban officials in the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. The allegation was that he had received under rather odd circumstances a substantial amount of money in the Cuban Embassy, and the statement was made by one who claimed to have seen this transaction take place. After a very thorough and detailed examination of the informer, it finally turned out by the informer's own admission that the information was entirely erroneous, and was made for the purpose of advancing the informer's own standing with the Central Intelligence Agency and it was subsequently rejected by the informer in its entirety.

Representative Ford. Was there any other evidence or alleged evidence— 

Mr. McCone. Parenthetically, I might add a word for the record that the date that the informer gave as to the date in time of this alleged transaction was impossible because through other, from other information we determined that Oswald was in the United States at that particular time.

Representative Ford. Did the Central Intelligence Agency ever make an investigation or did it ever check on Mr. Ruby's trip to Cuba or any connections he might have had with the Castro government?

Mr. McCone. Not to my knowledge.

Mr. Helms. We had no information.

Mr. McCone. We had no information.

Representative Ford. Central Intelligence Agency has no information of any connection of Ruby to the Castro government?

Mr. McCone. That is right.

Representative Ford. Did you ever make a check of that?

Mr. Helms. We checked our records to see if we had information and found we did not. 

Representative Ford. That would indicate; the fact that you checked your records?

Mr. Helms. That would indicate that if we had received information from those officers who were in positions of responsibility at the times in question to see if anybody had any recollection of any contact having ever been suggested with this man. This also turned out to be negative, so there is no material in the Central Intelligence Agency, either in the records or in the mind of any of the individuals, that there was any contact had or ever contemplated with him.

Mr. Rankin. Would that be true, Mr. Helms, even after the Commission completed its report, you would keep the matter open if there was anything new that developed in the future that could be properly presented to the authorities?

Mr. Helms. Yes. I would assume the case will never be closed.

Mr. Rankin. Mr. McCone, do you have any ideas about improving the security provisions for the President that you would like to relate to the Commission?

Mr. McCone. Well, this is, in my opinion, a very important question which I am sure this Commission will—has and will—devote a considerable amount of thought to, and undoubtedly have some recommendations as part of its report.

Mr. Rankin. Your Agency does have an important function in some aspects.

Mr. McCone. We have a very important function in connection with the foreign travels of the President, and I would like to inform the Commission as to how we discharge that responsibility by quickly reviewing the chronology of the Central Intelligence Agency's support of President Kennedy's visit to Mexico City from the 29th of June to the 2d of July 1962.

Mr. Rankin. Will you please do that.

The Chairman. Director, is that a security matter?

Mr. McCone. No. I think I can handle this for the record.

The Chairman. Very well.

Mr. McCone. If I have to make a remark or two off the record I will ask that privilege.

That visit, as I said, started on the 29th of June. On the 28th of April, in anticipation of the visit, instructions were transmitted to Mexico for the Ambassador to coordinate planning and informational guidance for the advance party of the Secret Service.

We asked that the Secret Service be given information on local groups and persons who would cause disturbances, embarrassments or physical harm, an estimate of the reaction and ability of the Mexican government to cope with incidents, and preparation for special briefings to the Embassy officials and the Secret Service.

These instructions were given two months before the trip.

On the 15th of May, we received confirmed information that the President would visit Mexico on the specific dates. On the 1st of June the Secret Service was supplied by the Agency with the detailed survey of Mexican security forces that would be called upon to protect the President.

Friendly and allied governments were informed of the visit and their cooperation and pertinent information support was solicited. From this date through the 2d of July daily information reports were furnished to the State Department, the Secret Service, the FBI and the military services.

That is from the 1st of June to the 2d of July, a period of 31, 32 days. On the 8th of June the Secret Service advance party was briefed in detail by a group of officers of the Agency on the Mexican government's plans for the protection of the President, including current information on the size, strength and capabilities of potential troublemakers.

Hazardous locations and times in the planned itinerary were identified, political and economic issues that might be involved by hostile elements for demonstrations were specified.

On the 11th of June, the Secret Service advance party left for Mexico supported by additional security personnel to assist in coordinating an informational report and the followup activity required.

Especially prepared national intelligence estimates on the current security conditions in Mexico was approved by the United States Intelligence Board on the 13th of June.

On the 15th of June arrangements were completed to reinforce communications facilities. On the 24th of June a conference at the State Department was held at the request of the President for reviewing security measures, and this meeting I attended personally, and reported to the State Department on the essence of all that had gone before.

Emergency contingency plans were discussed and a consensus was reached that the President should make the visit as scheduled.

On the 27th of June, a final updated special national intelligence estimate was prepared, and this indicated no basic changes in the security assessment that the Mexican government was prepared to cope with foreseeable security contingencies.

On the 28th of June, a final briefing report was prepared for the Director's review which indicated the security precautions of the Mexican government had effectively forestalled major organized incidents, and our informed estimate was that the President would receive a great welcome.

The report was presented to the President personally by the Director at noon in a final meeting prior to departure on this trip.

From the 29th of June to the 2d of July in Washington headquarters, headquarters components remained on a 24-hour alert for close support of the embassy and the Secret Service.

So, not only was the Central Intelligence Agency and its various components involved in this for a period of 2 months in close collaboration with the Secret Service, but by bringing in the United States Intelligence Board we brought in all of the intelligence assets of the United States Government in connection with this particular trip. I thought this procedure should be followed regularly on all trips that
