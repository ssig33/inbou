Re Bern letter 1/5/65.  
On 1/6/65, John Dimmer, Chief, Office of Special Assistant (covert CIA) the Embassy, Bern, confidentially informed that he had learned that Lane was to speak in Zurich, Switzerland, some time in the next two weeks on the subject of Oswald's innocence in the killing of President Kennedy. Lane is allegedly to be sponsored by Heinrich Buchbinder, well known Swiss Trotskyite who is prominent in the Swiss Movement Against Atomic Armament (Schweizerische Bewegung gegen die Atomare Aufrüstung - SBGA).  
Dimmer's request, he was furnished background material concerning Lane. Dimmer stated that he would keep this office informed of further developments in this matter.
