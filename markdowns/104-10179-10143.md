DIR INFO SJAN WAVE CITE MEXI 1743  
GYROSE  

1. JEREMY K BENADUM, WHO HANDLES (LITEMPO VISA) CHANNEL, BELIEVES PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE GET MEXICAN VISA BY APPROACHING MEXICAN CONSUL. MIAMI OR SJAN. PROBLEM IS GETTING GOBERNACION VISA PERMIT. GOBERNACION HAS LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF APPLICATIONS STACKED UP ON WHICH ACTION NORMALLY BUREAUCRATICALLY SLOW ANYWAY AND ON WHICH GOBERNACION DOES NOT REALLY DESIRE TAKEN ACTION, BECAUSE OF DANGER CUBANS WILL BECOME PUBLIC CHARGES. BEST CHANCE IS FOR ANY HIGH LEVEL MEXICAN OFFICIAL IN MEXICO CITY FRONT FOR AMBANG-I AND FOLLOW UP CASE CLOSELY THROUGH GOBERNACION. NEXT BEST CHANCE IF A-1 HAS NO SUCH HIGH LEVEL CONTACT IS TO USE ANY CUBAN FRIEND OF HIS MEXI WHO HAS SUCH HIGH LEVEL MEXICAN CONTACT. THIS IS USUAL METHOD. USE OF [STATION] LITEMPO CHANNEL WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BURN ODYOKE INTEREST IN A-1 BECAUSE HIGH LEVEL GOBERNACION OFFICIALS SOMETIMES KNOWINGLY USE LITEMPO VISA CHANNEL THEMSELVES FOR "PERSONAL INTEREST" CASES AND MIGHT VERY WELL BE USING THE CHANNEL THEMSELVES IN A-1'S CASE, IF BY COINCIDENCE A-1'S CUBAN FRIEND MEXI HAPPENED TO APPROACH THEM. STATION HAS NOT DISCOURAGED SUCH USE.  

2. WOULD BE PREFERABLE FOR A-1 TO TRY ON HIS OWN AS INDICATED. BUT MEXI CAN AND WILL ON REQUEST INITIATE AND FOLLOW THROUGH ON ACTION. IMPORTANT THING IS THAT ACTION NOT BE CARRIED ON BY A-1 AND STATION SIMULTANEOUSLY. THERE WILL BE NO NEED FOR [STATION] TO INTERVENE WITH MEXI CONSUL MIAMI ONCE VISA PERMIT ISSUED. IF NO QUESTION A-1 CAN PROVE HIS ABILITY REENTER PROBABLE WITH SOME DOCUMENT. IF SUCH QUESTION ARISES, MEXI CONSUL WILL PROBABLY CONTACT [STATION CASE OFFICER] ON OWN. IF NOT A-1 CAN SUGGEST CALLING THEIR USUAL [ODACID] CONTACT MEXI. PLEASE ADVISE.
