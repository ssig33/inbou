Enclosed for the Bureau is one copy of a self-explanatory Paris Embassy CAS (Controlled American Source - CIA) memorandum along with a copy of the letter in Spanish mentioned in the memorandum.

The Paris Office has referred this matter to the High General Staff (HGS), Madrid, Spain, with a request for investigation by that service in an effort to locate and identify the sender of the letter; and to interview him for any data he may be able to supply. The results of this Paris request of the HGS will be promptly reported when available.

There are no traces from Madrid on Antilin PERIS, which according to CAS, Madrid, is almost certainly a ruse. Needless to say there is no return address on the letter envelope, which was mailed from Barcelona on 26 September 1964. CAS, Madrid has forwarded us a copy of the letter on the off chance that we may have received similar allegations; in such case Madrid would appreciate learning the details so that they might inform the Embassy. It was also suggested that we show you this letter.
