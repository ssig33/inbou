On 11 January 1956 (Col) Carlos PAZ Tejada, under the alias of (Col) Francisco COSENZA, wrote to (Col) José Gálvez in Costa Rica from San José. The letter was addressed to the accommodation address (Justo García, Apartado Postal 2692, San José), and is translated as follows:

"Although I have wanted very much to answer your letter of 7 December, many things have obstructed it and so time has slipped by. I wish that I have been able to write you only today.

In spite of the latest news, which you must be familiar with, I think that what happened is nothing but an incident, natural to the trade. I really believe that the circumstances with those who were spreading war trying to negotiate and participate in the running which there would be without such a plan, is not more than a loss of time and some short-range hopes, but not in an important manner. Something positive is being accomplished with a general line of forcing María Dolores to act in a manner which is good for us. I hope to continue in the activity and I have exactly the patience of a pilot for a fly to fall into it.

With relation to what you transcribed from Doña Tisha, the fact that she was formerly so close to me, has retired from me and has dedicated himself to the task of defending because he was unable to get something he wanted from me. Since he has nothing else to say, he says that I have very strange relations or that I belong to the comrades. You will understand, this is nothing more than a disloyalty, in which he is an expert.

"I think that, depending on how things appear, we should activate our requests and also contemplate new solutions to the large problems. I am writing today to the family to maintain a continuity of action and to see if the prevailing circumstances can be taken advantage of and given a purpose.

I consider it extremely important that we maintain ourselves in closer correspondence than up to now. I understand that it is I who have failed to answer you, but I hope that the explanation of the events is sufficient. Failing to do so would be to fail to show interest and would even result in everything becoming cold and paralyzed for who knows how long.

The big cars are very affectionately. I think that the problems that they cause each other are completely negative and that they cause us to deviate from the only road which should be followed."

"Even though there have been many things, I wish to give you a response to your letter of the 7th of this month, which has been delayed little by little. What has happened is that I have not had the will, until now, to write you.

Despite the latest news, which you have been informed of, I believe that the situation is still the same. I have been trying to get the best from the beginning and for that reason, I have tried to obtain the most possible from my part. I think that the problems that arise are not a loss more than a blessing of the same."
