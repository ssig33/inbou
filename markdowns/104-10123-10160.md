Mr. Marx Holder requires a place for the use of 1723 (172341) an Agent of Security Research Staff. He has obtained permission of SAC/FPO and requests SE/2 to grant security approval.

Since this site is to be terminated on 1 March 1961 and has advised that it is leased in alias no security can be ascertained.

Recommend that SB/1 be advised that there is no security concern to the contemplated use of this site.
