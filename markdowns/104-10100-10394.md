1. ODCOL MEXI SHOULD BE GIVEN LEAD ON MILTON LYN, AVOIDING KUBARK INVOLVEMENT THIS CASE.  
2. NO TRACES ERNESTO ABREU GONZ. AGREE HE IS TARGET FOR DEVELOPMENT FOR PROBLEM OPERATIONS. INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS WITH ABREU GONZ ON LYN CASE AND POSSIBLY LATER INTRODUCTION TO ODCOL AGENT MAY PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR ASSESSMENT AND DEVELOPING.  

**コメント:** Ref reported U.S. citizens. LYN told Merida police chief of drug case. Chief suggested U.S. agent be inserted in set. Merida wishes develop Chief Abreu for problem ops.
