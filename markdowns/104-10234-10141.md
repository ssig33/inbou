1. REUTERS DISPATCH DATED HAVANA 16 MARCH REPORTED WIDESPREAD PURGE UNDERWAY OF MILITARY OFFICERS, HIGH OFFICIALS THAT MAJOR EFIGENIO AMEJEIRAS, DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE ARMED FORCES AND MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE CUBAN COMMUNIST PARTY, HAS BEEN DISMISSED FROM HIS OFFICES AND IS TO STAND TRIAL BEFORE A COURT MARTIAL. THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO ANNOUNCED "THE ARREST OF SEVERAL DOZEN OTHER OFFICIALS" ON CHARGES OF INDULGING "LA DOLCE VITA". AN ELABORATION OF THIS CHARGE WAS MADE BY CASTRO IN HIS 13 MARCH SPEECH WHEREIN HE ATTACKED MEMBERS OF CUBAN MISSIONS ABROAD WHO SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS IN "VAPORS OF PARTIES AND GOOD BRANDY AND IN COMPANY OF PRETTY YOUNG GIRLS." CASTRO ADDED THAT THOSE GUILTY OF "PLAYBOY BEHAVIOR" WOULD BE DRAFTED INTO THE ARMY OR SENT TO WORK ON THE FARM.

2. QUOTING AN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE, REUTERS REPORTED THAT MAJOR EFIGENIO AMEJEIRAS, DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE ARMED FORCES AND MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE CUBAN COMMUNIST PARTY, HAS BEEN DISMISSED FROM HIS OFFICES AND IS TO STAND TRIAL BEFORE A COURT MARTIAL. THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO ANNOUNCED "THE ARREST OF SEVERAL DOZEN OTHER OFFICIALS" ON CHARGES OF INDULGING "LA DOLCE VITA".

3. BACKGROUND: THE PURGE HAS BEEN PRECEDED BY THE TRIAL ON 7 MARCH BY A REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL OF SEVEN CUBANS FOR COMPLICITY IN A PLOT TO OVERTHROW FIDEL CASTRO. THE ACCUSED ALLEGEDLY HAD THE SUPPORT OF SOME CUBAN EXILE LEADERS NOW RESIDING IN THE U.S. TWO OF THE SEVEN, ROLANDO CUBELA AND RAMON GUIN, HELD THE RANK OF MAJOR, HIGHEST RANK IN THE ARMED SERVICES. THE STATE PROSECUTOR REQUESTED DEATH FOR CUBELA AND THREE OTHERS.

4. MAJOR CUBELA WAS A POPULAR AND PROMINENT UNIVERSITY STUDENT LEADER, AN ARDENT REVOLUTIONARY AND ONE OF THE EARLY FRIENDS OF CASTRO DURING THE BATISTA REGIME. CUBELA WAS ALSO A CLOSE FRIEND OF CASTRO AND UNTIL THE ARREST RANKED HIGH AMONG THE LEADERS OF THE REGIME. HIS ARREST AND ABJECT CONFESSION AT THE PUBLIC TRIAL CONDUCTED IN STALINIST FASHION TRIGGERED OFF A SERIES OF STUDENT REACTIONS.

5. UPI REPORTS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL NEWS SERVICES, INCLUDING ACCOUNTS OF REFUGEES WHO DEPARTED RECENTLY FROM CUBA, TESTIFIED TO THE FACT THAT ANTI-GOVT STUDENT AGITATIONS OCCURRED. WALL SCRIBBLINGS ON UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS THREATENED CASTRO, ONE READING: "ONE HEAD PAYS FOR ANOTHER," ANOTHER READ "OUT WITH FIDEL."

6. BECAUSE OF THE STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE TRIAL, CASTRO REQUESTED THE STATE PROSECUTOR NOT TO IMPOSE THE DEATH SENTENCES. IN ORDER TO PLACATE ADVERSE PUBLIC OPINION THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS WERE GIVEN WIDE COVERAGE ON BOTH RADIO AND TELEVISION CIRCUITS. AS A RESULT, CUBELA AND OTHERS GRANTED CLEMENCY AND SENTENCED TO LENGTH PRISON TERMS.

7. THE CUBELA TRIAL WAS USED AS A PEG, I.E., GUILT BY ASSOCIATION IN THE DISMISSAL AND CHARGES LEVELED AGAINST MAJOR AMEJEIRAS WHOSE LOYALTY TO THE REVOLUTION IS "UNDISPUTED" BY CASTRO. HOWEVER, AMEJEIRAS WAS STRIPPED OF HIS MILITARY RANK AND CHARGED WITH THE CRIME OF BEING A PLAYBOY, LIVING THE GAY LIFE.

8. AMEJEIRAS WAS ONE OF CASTRO'S FIRST REVOLUTIONARY FOLLOWERS. HE HAD BEEN WITH CASTRO SINCE 1956, WAS ONE OF THE SURVIVORS OF THE GRANMA EXPEDITION, FOUGHT IN THE SIERRA MAESTRA IN 1957-58 AND HAD HELD HIGH OFFICE SINCE 1959. IN OCT 1965 HE WAS NAMED TO THE HUNDRED MAN CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE CUBAN COMMUNIST PARTY.

9. RUMORS ARE CIRCULATING THAT BLAS ROCA CALDERO, MEMBER OF THE SECRETARIAT OF THE CP AND CHAIRMAN OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STUDIES COMMITTEE, WILL SHORTLY BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL. SIMILARLY, THE CHARGES OF MALPRACTICES AGAINST THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS IMPUGNS THE LOYALTY OF FOREIGN MINISTER RAUL ROA GARCIA HIMSELF. ANOTHER MINISTER UNDER SUSPICION, I.E., GUILT BY ASSOCIATION, IS PAURE CHOON, MINISTER OF TRANSPORTATION. THE ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP OF THE 100-MAN CENTRAL COMMITTEE CREATED IN LATE 1965, MAY NOT BE SPARED AS THE PURGE GATHERS MOMENTUM.

10. THE UNDERLYING CAUSE FOR THE "SHOW TRIAL" OF CUBELA, THE ARREST OF THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND THE OUTLANDISH CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE CP AND MINISTERIAL OFFICIALS ARISES FROM THE IRREVERSIBLE FAILURES OF THE GOVT IN THE HANDLING OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS. THE SCARCITY OF BASIC FOOD PRODUCTS HAS WORSENED. RICE, ROOT CROPS, MILK, MEAT CONTINUE NOW BELOW THE 1957-59 LEVEL, DESPITE SEVEN YEARS OF "COMMUNIST PLANNING". THERE ARE SERIOUS SHORTAGES OF MEDICINE, TEXTILES AND HOUSING. THE LATTER HAS DETERIORATED IN URBAN AREAS TO A LEVEL FAR BELOW PRE-WAR STANDARDS. SIMILARLY, CASTRO REPORTED THAT THE SUGAR CROP THIS YEAR WILL FALL FAR BELOW THE SIX MILLION TONS HARVESTED IN 1965. SINCE SUGAR ACCOUNTS FOR SOME 80% OF TOTAL FOREIGN TRADE EARNINGS, 1966 INCOME FROM SUGAR SALES, FACED WITH DEPRESSED WORLD MARKET PRICES, WILL NOT IN ANY WAY MEET THE COST OF BASIC IMPORTS, ESSENTIAL FOR SUSTAINING THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. CASTRO HAS SOUGHT TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE ON THE ECONOMY BY PERMITTING THE EXODUS OF SOME 400 REFUGEES PER MONTH WHO ARE STREAMING INTO THE U.S. OTHER FAILURES INCLUDE THE FUNCTION OF THE GOC.

11. ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE WHICH HAS ALMOST COME TO A HALT. IN THE INTEREST OF ECONOMY SOME 60,000 EMPLOYEES ARE BEING DISMISSED FROM THEIR JOBS. IMPORTANT BUREAUS ARE DENUDED OF COMPETENT STAFFS. ALSO, THE POLICY OF REPLACING EXPERIENCED FUNCTIONARIES WITH UNQUALIFIED CP STALWARTS HAS ALSO BEEN EXTENDED INTO THE ARMED SERVICES. COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN PLACED IN COMMAND POSTS AND THEIR WORD TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER THOSE WHO ARE TECHNICALLY COMPETENT BUT NOT PARTY MEMBERS.

12. PSYCH EXPLOITATION IN MEDIA: A. EMPHASIZE POINT THAT SHOW TRIAL AND PURGES DEMONSTRATE THAT IN THE PATTERN OF ALL DICTATORS, CASTRO GRASPING AT STRAWS, HOPING DIVERT PUBLIC ATTENTION FROM MOUNTING INTERNAL DIFFICULTIES; B. COMPARE CASTRO TO NKRUMAH, SUKARNO AND OTHERS AS LEADERS WHO HAVE BANKRUPTED THEIR NATIONAL ECONOMIES AND SOLD OUT THEIR NATION TO COMMUNISM; C. PORTRAY CASTRO IN STATE OF PANIC, HIS RECENT RANTINGS AND RAVINGS ARE REMINISCENT OF OTHER DEFUNCT DICTATORS; D. RAISE QUESTION WHO CAN NOW CONSIDER HIMSELF SAFE WHEN CASTRO IS TURNING AGAINST HIS MOST LOYAL FRIENDS. SIMILARLY, CASTRO HAS LASHED OUT AGAINST COMMUNIST CHINA AND YUGOSLAVIA, HIS FORMER ALLIES; E. SHOW THAT UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS WHO IN EARLY 1965 WERE "PURGED" ON TRUMPED UP CHARGES OF HOMOSEXUALITY ARE BECOMING ASSERTIVE. SIMILARLY, MILITARY OFFICERS, FALSELY ACCUSED, WILL CERTAINLY RESPOND. THE STUDENTS WITH THE MILITARY ARE THE TWO POWER GROUPS THAT CAN REVERSE THE TRENDS AS EXEMPLIFIED TODAY IN INDONESIA; F. LASTLY, AVOID ALL REFERENCES TO ALLEGATIONS OF GOC THAT KUBELA INVOLVED IN CUBELA PLOT.

13. ABOVE BACKGROUND AND INFO MAY BE PASSED TO LIAISON. 

14. FOR KUTUBE EXPLOITATION: A. STATIONS WITH CUBAN INSTALLATIONS AND/OR TRADE MISSIONS ARE REQUESTED MAKE MAXIMUM EFFORT ESTABLISH DIRECT OR INDIRECT CONTACTS WITH SELECTED CUBAN FOREIGN AND TRADE PERSONNEL IN THEIR AREAS. PURPOSE TO EMPHASIZE TO THEM THAT THEIR DOLCE VITA AND COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO HAVANA.
