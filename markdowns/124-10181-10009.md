ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY 11/22/63, DALLAS, TEXAS  
MISCELLANEOUS - INFORMATION CONCERNING  

On 6/22/64 [Mr. R. E. CARTER, CIA, London] on a highly confidential basis, furnished the following information which comes from a source on the Cuban Embassy, London, operated by British Security Service, MI-5 and British Secret Intelligence Service, MI-6. This conversation occurred on 3/8/64 and was between MARIO RIVA-PATTERSON, Counselor, Cuban Embassy, and an unidentified male visitor, possibly a Colombian. The conversation was in Spanish and indistinct at times. Information is as follows:  

"The visitor (after a question half of which is not heard) asks if in the case of the assassination of KENNEDY (??) FOSTER was ever in Cuba. RIVA replies in the negative. He says that this man applied for a visa to go to Cuba at the Consulate in Tampico. He was refused a visa. Had he been to Cuba he would have had his passport."  

VISITOR: "A typical F.B.I. job."  

RIVA: "A thing (??) of the Imperialists - to kill him in the end - really disgusting -"

It is possible that the individual referred to above as FOSTER may have been OSWALD. Above furnished for the Bureau's information.
