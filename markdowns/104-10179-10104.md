REPORTING AGENT:  
SUBJECT: Cira MARTINEZ, also "Josephine," very closely connected to Manuel RAY.  
SOURCE: Maria DIAZ Mavas, married to Dr. Ricardo LACHIM. Has connected in Havana with various anti-Communist organizations.  

On a visit I made to source, she told me that she had not met Cira MARTINEZ in Havana. That Mrs. MARTINEZ used the pseudonym "Josephine" and was married to architect Frank MARTINEZ. That both subject and her husband were persons in the absolute confidence of engineer Manuel RAY, and "Josephine" had been RAY's secretary for a long time.  

Source claims to have learned from "Josephine" that RAY wanted her to join the executive of the organization J.U.R.E., but she had refused because she did not agree with the policies of this organization, that "Josephine" had described this organization as a political movement the same as Castroism, only changing the name of the leader. That she knows the plan of this organization is to organize all anti-BATISTA and anti-CASTRO organizations, under the direction of the J.U.R.E., and develop a nationalistic and especially an anti-American policy in order to be able to group all the elements existing in Cuba that have not figured prominently in the CASTRO regime. After the fall of the OAS regime, they plan to form a strong political party in Cuba and capitalize on the mistakes committed by the provisional government. With this objectives in mind, they will stay separated from the C.R.O. and from all relations with the U.S. Government in order to be able to carry out their plan freely.  

Mrs. Cira MARTINEZ lives with her husband at 1004 N. 17th St., Miami, phone number PL-2-0433 on which they talk to many persons related with RAY's plan.

NOTE: One of RAY's most trusted leaders in Miami is still Osorio DAVILA, former treasurer of the 26th of July Movement and man in the absolute confidence of Mayor SANDOVAL. For a long time DAVILA was the Chief of the Havana Immigration Department, until he came to the U.S., by boat from the coast of Florida.

8 Oct 62, subj: Cira MARTINEZ (cont.)  
Known leaders of J.U.R.E., because there is another group of individuals whose names are not advertised but who have common powers in the J.U.R.E. One of these men is "Eneldo Lazo," former leader of the 26th of July Movement, private secretary of the Commissioner of Havana Jose MALAVIA, and G-2 delegate in Havana City Hall. LAZO persecuted many persons in the City Hall because he was the one who made the lists of persons who should be watched, the G-2. He also had close connections with the Minister of the Interior, Jose A. MARINO, who kept informed about the persons under suspicion who worked in the Ministry of the Interior. One time LAZO visited MARINO and informed him, in the presence of MARINO's secretary, Lucy MENDEZ, that he should keep Captain Jorge SOFUS, and thanks to Lucy's warning, PADILLA took precautions and the plan could be carried out.

On Sunday, October 28, I met with Manolo RAY of the Revolutionary Syndicate of the People (RSP) at the San Juan Intercontinental Hotel, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. My main objectives were: (1) to elicit from him a list of Cubans presently associated with the Castro regime, who are critical of Castro and might be considered potential defectors; (2) to obtain a list of Cubans, either inside or outside the island, who could be available. In case of an emergency, to help in setting up some kind of provisional government; and (3) to have his general views on the possibility of an insurrectionary movement.  

Since I had arranged to return to Washington on the same day, I did not give RAY much time to do a thorough job. However, he was able to furnish me with a list of names, covering points (1) and (2). He promised to provide me with additional information after checking with some of his contacts in New York and Miami. His thoughts on the possibility of an insurrectionary movement will be the subject of a separate memorandum.  

The persons herein indicated are either in Cuba or are working for the Cuban Government. I add my own comments in parentheses, based on my conversations with RAY.
