**日時:** 22 June 1954  

The Subject is a covert employee of this Agency now in the United States for four weeks training and being considered for work with Staff C/CB in a highly sensitive assignment. Immigration authorities may submit questions through this Agency which will be reserved by the Subject, but requests to have the Subject testify in open court hearings must be refused.

1. Reference is made to the letter received by the Alien Affairs staff from the Immigration and Naturalization Service and reference to your request of 15 June 1954 to ascertain the details of the Subject's status with this Agency and prepare a reply to IAMS.

2. On 17 June 1954, Special Agent Chester P. Hargrove of this office interviewed Mr. Robert D. McGowan, Acting Chief, C/FR, Room 1128 "H" Building, and Mr. John Brown, Chief, C/Panama, Room 2201, regarding the Immigration request. The following information was obtained during this interview.

3. Mr. Brown indicated that from a security standpoint the interview would be a restriction to a controlled interview and that further consideration could be afforded the Subject if he is still a covert employee. The interview, however, would have to be coordinated with the request for accessible objections that might arise in the proposed assignment of the Subject.

4. Any contact with the Subject during his period of covert training from 6 July to approximately 15 August 1954 would have to be coordinated with Mr. Peter Hunt, Covert Training Officer, whose office is located in Building 31.

5. If the Staff C/CB does not materialize, the Subject will return to the Alien Affairs Branch on approximately 15 August 1954 as a case officer, and this position would also be jeopardized by undue publicity.

6. Mr. Pennington, Alien Affairs Staff, SC, contacted William A. Hogan, Special Assistant to the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization on 16 June 1954 requesting further information regarding their memorandum of 9 June 1954 on the Subject. Mr. Hogan explained that IAMS has a list of possible informants which contains the Subject's name. The people on this list are being contacted for use on a continuing basis where specific cases arise which might fall in their particular area of knowledge. At the present time, IAMS has no specific case concerning them want to contact the Subject, but they just want to know if he would be available in the future for use as an informant regarding various Communist activities of which the Subject has personal knowledge.

7. After his conversation with Mr. Hunt, Mr. Pennington indicated that a request for the IAMS project would not be coordinated at this time, but recommended to the extent that IAMS could submit specific questions to this Agency which could be directed to the Subject and the answers forwarded to IAMS. The refusal of their original request should be based on the sensitivity of the Subject's position which could be jeopardized by undue publicity and also that first the Subject must be frequently and adequately informed to indicate his personal contacts with this project.

It is recommended that the attached memorandum to IAMS and to the Chief, JH Division, with a carbon copy to Staff C/CB, be forwarded and that no further action be taken pending a report from Mr. Kane regarding the seriousness of the security flap from an operational standpoint.
