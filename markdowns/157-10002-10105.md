Mr. Schwarz. And then in 1947, did you join the CIA as head of the Soviet Intelligence Branch?  
Mr. Harvey. That is correct.  
Mr. Schwarz. Is that also counterespionage?  
Mr. Harvey. Yes, it was.  
Mr. Schwarz. And then between 1947 and 1952, you worked on Soviet counterespionage and certain special operations in the Department for Plans, is that right?  
Mr. Harvey. Well, that is correct. It was a particular command and staff responsibility on that period of, I would think probably eight to ten months, I headed a planning staff, along with that.  
Mr. Schwarz. In 1952, did you go to Berlin as chief of the CIA?  
Mr. Harvey. I did.  
Mr. Schwarz. And were you there until 1959?  
Mr. Harvey. Until the end of 1959.  
Mr. Schwarz. I understand, Mr. Harvey, that you had some rather substantial accomplishments there, such as the Berlin Tunnel.  
Mr. Harvey. Well, very briefly, that is an operation that Frank Rollet and I conceived some time before I went to Berlin.  
Senator Tower. You and who?  
Mr. Harvey. Frank Rollet, who for many years was one of the, if not the most, knowledgeable senior officer in the intelligence field.  
And one of the reasons I went to Berlin was to attempt to mount this operation.  
In substance, what it amounted to was setting up a fairly complex cover within a cover installation.  
Mr. Schwarz. Now, did a man call Justin O'Donnell work for you in Staff D?  
Mr. Harvey. Yes, he did.  
Mr. Schwarz. At some point, did Mr. O'Donnell recount to you a conversation concerning Patrice Lumumba?  
Mr. Harvey. Yes.  
Mr. Schwarz. Would you state what he said to you?  
Mr. Harvey. Briefly, Mr. O'Donnell came to me and said that he had been approached by Richard Bissell, who was then Deputy Director for Plans, to undertake an operation in the Congo, one of the objectives of which was the elimination of Patrice Lumumba. He also told me that he had declined to undertake this assignment.  
Mr. Schwarz. Did Mr. Bissell subsequently have a conversation with you in which he also recounted the fact that he had requested Mr. O'Donnell to undertake such an operation?  
Mr. Harvey. Yes.  
Mr. Schwarz. Now, the material commencing on handwritten page 4 and commencing in the middle of page 3 of the Senator's notes, reflects in your judgment the conversation that you had with Mr. Silver?  
Mr. Harvey. That is my best guess.  
It may also, however, include his own thinking and so forth.  
I doubt if it includes -- it certainly would not include any specific discussions, I don't think, with other officers, because Mr. Silver was under specific instructions not to discuss this as such with anybody else, at least without clearing it with me first.  
Mr. Schwarz. And he starts, for example, by talking about "Legal, ethical, morale, operational problems" and so forth, and that reflects the conversation you had with Mr. Silver?  
Mr. Harvey. Yes, it does.  
Mr. Schwarz. Down toward the end of entry 3b -- and 3 has the heading "Maximum security" -- do you see that on page 4?  
Mr. Harvey. Yes, I see it.  
Mr. Schwarz. There is a sentence which reads as follows -- two sentences, which I should read into the record, three sentences.  
"Within Kubark" -- now, is that the CIA?  
Mr. Harvey. Yes, I take it.  
Mr. Schwarz. Then it appears to say f-a-n-f-o-r-n DCI matter. What does that mean?  
Mr. Harvey. I am not sure. The closest I could come to that is a fairly illogical Fanfani, and Fanfani was never even dreamed of, as far as I know, in any such context.  
Fanfani -- Burton Wides raised that with me, and I just had to throw up my hands. I just don't know.  
Mr. Schwarz. And you don't know what the reference to DCI in the notes means?  
Mr. Harvey. No, I am sorry, I do not, at this point, Mr. Schwarz.  
Mr. Schwarz. Okay.  
Mr. Harvey. Are you asking me to try to interpret the portion of this that is in my handwriting, or are you satisfied at this point?  
Mr. Schwarz. Well, the other items, it seems to me, are either not important or are understandable. Maybe some of the members have questions.
