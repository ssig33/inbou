15 JULY 1963 AN INDIVIDUAL ASSOCIATED WITH THE COUP D'ÉTAT GROUP HEADED BY DR. TRAN KIM TUYEN; CURRENTLY AN ADVISOR AT THE PRESIDENCY, SAID THAT THEIR NATIONALIST, ANTI-COMMUNIST COUP WOULD OCCUR "SOON." HOWEVER, AS THE VIET CONG WERE REPORTEDLY PLANNING TO INTENSIFY THEIR ACTIVITIES DURING THE WEEK PRIOR TO THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE GENEVA ACCORDS, THE COUP WOULD NOT BE STAGED UNTIL AFTER THAT DATE. THE COUP WOULD BE DIRECTED AGAINST PRESIDENT DIEM AS WELL AS THE NGO DINH NHU AND THE GROUP PLANNED TO ESTABLISH A CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT.
