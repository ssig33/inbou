1. FYI, SENIOR RUDOV OFFICIALS ONLY, A STRIKE FORCE OF CUBAN REVOLUTIONARIES  
HONDURAS 1200, INVADED CUBA BY SEA 17 APRIL AT OCCHOS BAY, LAS VILLAS PROVINCE.  
AFTER STRIKING INITIAL BEACH HEAD WITH SURPRISE, AGAINST HEAVY OPPOSITION, THE DDC  
SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING AIR SUPERIORITY USING T-33 JET TRAINERS AND MIG-15s.  
BY 18 APRIL UP TO 12 SOVIET-BUILT TANKS WERE BROUGHT INTO ACTION.  

2. THE RESISTANCE LOST ONE BEACH HEAD ON 17 APRIL AND THEIR RESISTANCE FOOTHOLD  
ON 19 APRIL. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THESE FACTORS:

(B) INABILITY TO WITHSTAND HEAVY TANK ASSAULT ON A BEACH COMBAT ZONE.  
(C) OVERWHELMING ENEMY MAN POWER.  

3. THIS STRIKE FORCE WAS THE MAIN REBEL EFFORT DURING THE PERIOD 16-20 APRIL.  

4. NO RELIABLE DATA ON THIS BASE HAS BEEN RECOVERED, CAPTURED, OR KILLED. BEACH
