Public Surveys Institute
General Polling Service

532 Fidelity Union Life Building
1511 Bryan Street
Dallas, Texas
Telephone: Riverside 1-3674

Dear Mr. Noemayr:

Your Cover

1. Cover has been contrived for you with two notional organizations, Public Surveys Institute and Betwins Travel Folders.

2. Public Surveys Institute is a national organization which is ostensibly engaged in conducting all types of polls to determine public reactions on matters of interest to its many clients. This organization is located at Suite 532 Fidelity Union Life Building, 1511 Bryan Street, Dallas, Texas, telephone: Riverside 1-3674. The Institute is directed by Albert E. Johnson, a fictitious individual.

3. The above address is in actuality that of a telephone answering service where all normal calls of inquiry are handled by unwitting personnel during the course of their regular duties. However, any call which requires special attention is referred to a cleared and witting individual who has contact with headquarters. This person is adequately prepared to acknowledge your relationship with your cover firm and also answer any inquiries concerning you or your cover organization.

4. In addition to the above arrangement, you also have a contract with another national firm to submit photographs and reports which are to be utilized in the preparation of travel brochures. This firm is Betwins Travel Folders which is located at Box 2101, 50 East 34th Street, New York, New York, Telephone: Murray Hill 7-1473. Betwins is directed by Charles H. Betwin, a fictitious individual, and is engaged in the preparation of material for travel folders, brochures, package tours, etc.

5. The above address for Betwins is in actuality located in the office of a cleared attorney who is prepared to backstop both the cover firm and your association with Betwins Travel Folders. This person also has contact with headquarters.

6. You are engaged on a contract basis to provide photographs and reports relating to possible tours, places of interest, eating establishments, hotels, etc. This information is then edited by Betwins and sold to various clients who desire travel folders.

7. You also have legitimate cover in the form of your free lance photography and short story writing. The past publication of this work can be used as a supplement to your Betwins cover.

8. Your cover story for having been engaged by the Public Surveys Institute is as follows;

During a visit to the United States in May 1957, you became acquainted with Albert E. Johnson, the Director of Public Surveys Institute. Johnson indicated that he was interested in engaging the services of several people to organize and conduct polls in various Latin American areas.

Since you were already located in Cuba and had a knowledge of the language and customs, he expressed an interest in employing you in Cuba. As you felt this type of work would not conflict with your photographic efforts, you accepted the position effective May 1, 1957, in order to have an extra source of income.

Early in 1958, Johnson advised you that he had acquired several promising accounts who were interested in Mexico and desired to transfer you to Mexico City since you had both experience and the necessary language qualification. You readily agreed to the transfer and planned to leave for Mexico during the latter part of May after a short vacation in the United States.

9. Your cover story for having been engaged by Betwins Travel Folders is as follows;

While visiting in the United States during April 1958 prior to your departure for Mexico, you became acquainted with Charles H. Betwin through Albert Johnson in New York. Betwin had seen some of your published work and expressed an interest in engaging your services on a part-time basis in Mexico. Since it meant an additional source of income as well as an opportunity to utilize your photographic talents, you readily accepted his offer. You were to photograph various places which were of interest to Betwin's clients and also forward information relating to prices, possible package tours, historical points of interest, etc.

11. It is understood that there actually will be no disbursement of funds for salary or other purposes to you through your cover firm; and therefore, arrangements for salary payments are a matter of concern between you and your division case officer. However, precautions must be taken to ensure that the arrangements made will not conflict with your cover story.

12. Your income tax returns will be filed with the Internal Revenue Tax Unit stationed at headquarters in accordance with Agency FI 20-660-h.

13. Should you at any time feel the necessity for a modification of this cover arrangement, or supplementing the cover outside of this present arrangement, or if any problems arise affecting your cover, direct a routine communication to your cover firms outlining the need or situation and concurrently notify your case officer so that he may check with headquarters. Subsequently, you will receive advice from your cover concerns as would be normal and also be provided with official compatible instructions from your case officer.

14. With regard to any persons desiring to apply for a position with either cover firm, you are instructed to state that to the best of your knowledge and belief, the firms are adequately staffed. However, told to submit his application to the New York or Texas address, which ever applies, where it will receive due consideration.

15. You understand that these cover facilities have been established through cleared cooperative individuals who are witting, but not actually a part of the Agency.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Contract Personnel Division
VIA: FI/OFS (Miss Paxton)
SUBJECT: Arthur G. VAIVADA
Amendment of Contract

1. It is requested that Subject's contract effective 1 June 1957 be amended to include under Paragraph B, Allowances, that Subject be entitled to the Educational Allowance for his children, effective from the initial date of the contract.

2. The above provision was inadvertently omitted from Subject's contract by the Area Desk, and since the Station notified Subject he was entitled to this allowance, it would be appreciated if this matter be corrected and the contract amended accordingly. The error comes to the attention of the Area Desk that Subject's claim for educational allowance dated 18 April 1958, has turned down by Plans Division because of the aforementioned omission from the contract.
