# DDO INSTRUCTION NO. 50-10

**発信者（発）:** William E. Nelson, Deputy Director for Operations  
**日時:** 4 September 1973

1. **GENERAL**  
   Elemental in the conduct of clandestine operations is the use of human agents to accomplish the missions of the Operations Directorate. In general, it is DDO policy to select agent assets with primary regard to the agents' abilities, target access, and security, and with few restrictions as to their origins, professions or status as members of particular groups. The basic rule is that any consenting adult may be used by the Operations Directorate. There are, however, certain sensitive categories of individuals whose operational use by the Operations Directorate is prohibited or in some way restricted for reasons not necessarily related to security considerations.

2. **PURPOSE**  
   The purpose of this instruction is to set forth the prohibitions and policy restrictions (as distinguished from security restrictions) which currently pertain to the operational use of various categories of individuals, together with the special approval procedures to be followed in certain cases. Where appropriate, reference has been made to another publication which provides more detailed guidance than has been attempted in this instruction. The special approval procedures set forth in this instruction do not supersede or alter in any way the requirements for covert approval contained in DOI and DOI-F 10-5.

3. **DEFINITIONS**  
   Within the context of this instruction, the definitions listed below will apply. Special note must be taken of the fact that the key term "operational use" employed throughout this instruction has been defined in the most succinct manner consistent with clarity. It has not been feasible, however, to cover in a definition the entire scope of possible variations in operational circumstances which may be encountered in DDO activities. The definition of "operational use" is intended to provide guidance for the majority of cases, and must be employed with responsible operational judgment.

4. **RESTRICTIONS ON OPERATIONAL USE**  
   Restrictions on the operational use of individuals or groups are of four types and cover twenty-five separate categories as outlined below and as described in greater detail in paragraphs 5 through 8 of this instruction.

5. **OPERATIONAL USE PROHIBITED**  
   a. Members and Trainees of ACTION  
   (1) It is Agency policy that members and trainees of ACTION will not be used in any capacity, with or without remuneration, by the Agency or by organizations under its jurisdiction.  
   (2) It is Agency policy that former members of ACTION may be employed or used by the Agency or by organizations under its jurisdiction only in accordance with the following:  
   (3) Former trainees whose ACTION service included duty or training overseas are subject to the rules governing employment or use of former members of ACTION.  
   (4) A former member or trainee of ACTION whose employment or use is permitted by subparagraph (2) or (3) above may not be assigned to or used in a country for which he had been trained or to which he had been assigned while with ACTION.

6. **EXTRA-AGENCY CONCURRENCE REQUIRED**  
   a. Employees of Other U.S. Government Agencies  
   Approval for the operational use of staff or contract (including foreign) employees of other U.S. Government agencies will be granted only in cases where the employee's parent agency in Washington has been notified and has approved of the intended operational use in accordance with the provisions of DOI 10-5.

7. **APPROVAL BY THE DDO REQUIRED**  
   Approval by the Deputy Director for Operations for the operational use of any individual who falls into one of the categories described in this paragraph will be requested by memorandum. The individual's covert approval status will be described in the memorandum to the Deputy Director for Operations, together with a concise explanation of the intended operational use.

8. **INDIVIDUAL CHANGES OF STATUS OR CATEGORY**  
   When an individual undergoes a change of status which places him in one of the restricted categories described above, or transfers him from one category to another, his operational use or continued operational use is contingent upon approval or reapproval for his new status.

9. **INTERPRETATION OR MODIFICATION OF RESTRICTIONS**  
   Certain of the policy restrictions described in this instruction are subject to interpretation, extension, or modification by the Deputy Director for Operations. 

10. **SIGNATURE**  
   William E. Nelson, Deputy Director for Operations.
