1. LA部タスクフォースは、ケネディ大統領の暗殺に関連する記録を調査するために、1976年10月中旬に正式に組織されました。その目的は、1960年1月1日から1965年1月1日までに行われたすべての機関のキューバに対する作戦を調査することでした（1963年11月22日までの期間に集中）。研究者は、ケネディ大統領に対する行動を促す可能性のある証拠に注意を払っていました。研究者はまた、米国/CIAに対して明らかに向けられた活動にも注意を払っていました。

2. この調査のための資料は、LADレジストリ、キューバデスクの機械運用、およびこの目的のためにISS（情報サービススタッフ）によって準備された特別な包括的ファイルリストから取得されました。調査に関連する資料は、約900の運用フォルダーと関連する201のドシエに及ぶと考えられていましたが、徹底的なレビューが行われた結果、2000を超えるファイルが含まれることが判明しました。資料の日付を考慮すると、その多くは運用および主題に関するものであり、LAD/JFKタスクフォースファイルに記録され、保持されています。

3. 調査で使用された基準は、IGスタッフによって提供された33の参照条件に基づいています。これらの条件は、暗殺計画に関する問題に基づいて編纂されました。研究者は、各フォルダーの主題、活動の簡単な説明、および関連する文書のコピーを含む草案を提出しました。これらのメモランダムは、アルファベット順にファイルされ、LAD/JFKタスクフォースファイルの一部として保持されています。

4. 添付資料は以下の通りです：
   A) 調査結果の年表（125ページ）およびトップシークレットの付録（14ページ）  
   B) タスクフォースの参加者リストとその機能  
   C) 完全なLAD/JFKタスクフォースファイルの概要とその内容の説明。

CALLER : Says the reason may be they are trying to find out something about the man, because...  
LUISA : Says wait a minute, can you tell me?  
CALLER : We thought that if it had been, or appeared to the public to be one of the segregationist or those opposed to integration that had assassinated Kennedy, that there might be a civil struggle, or a Civil War in the United States. Considering the critical situation the country is going through, they will find a resolution to that man, no? Already it is more international. Are they going to find out for certain, who knows? Let's see what happens.  
LUISA : Laughs and asks what will happen.  
CALLER : Who knows?  
LUISA : Figuratively, one, two, three, and already there are three. (She laughs). What barbarians!  
CALLER : That will probably be the topic of conversation at Silvia's party today.  
LUISA : It was cancelled because they couldn't go.  
CALLER : Asks why.  
LUISA : "So they can later say that we were celebrating Kennedy's death" (sic). /COMMENT: appears that transcriber left out negative - can not say.  
Silvia agreed to change the party to next week, but not to coincide with the funeral (laugh).  
CALLER : One must take that into consideration.

LUISA : Says yes, but she doesn't know how everything is or if they have to stay at the Embassy; however, she believes that it will not be possible today, because everyone left for the airport and there isn't a car at the Embassy. Possibly tomorrow morning, instead of going to the study group, she will move.  
CALLER : Said he would talk to her tomorrow.  
LUISA : Said that he should inquire at the Embassy or at the house. If she doesn't stay at the Embassy, she will go to her house, where she will be by 10.

DBF 71256 (FBI) 日付 15 January 1962  
1961年1月19日、トーマス・フランク・ミカとトーマス・ローレンス・ケインはシカゴのFBIオフィスに次のことを伝えた：ケインは1959年5月にマイアミでカストロ運動にリクルートされたと言った。彼はキューバに行き、失望して1960年12月にアメリカに戻った。彼はシカゴのFRDオフィスを訪れ、カストロ政権の主要メンバー、フィデル・カストロ、ラウル・カストロ、そして「チェ」ゲバラを暗殺する計画について知らされた。FRDはケインにそのような試みに参加するように打診した。もしこの任務が成功裏に実行されれば、参加するメンバーには500,000ドルが支払われることになる。
