NOTE: (AELADLE) represents a collation of information provided by several reliable and sensitive sources. Some of the documentary (AELADLE) information is not to be released outside of the Clandestine Services. Components of CIA related to (AELADLE) information may be transmitted to CIA related stations only after it has been coordinated with C/SR/CI.

1. Source transited Helsinki in May 1961, at which time he obtained a visa at the Soviet Embassy from one KLIMOV. Beginning shortly after Christmas 1961 and continuing on and off for the next three months, Source was interrogated by the KGB in Moscow about his contacts with the KGB Legal Residency in Helsinki. Source prepared a written report giving in detail the physical description of all KGB officers who had met him in Helsinki.

2. In 1963 or 1964 Source was told by the KGB that it was unlikely he would ever be assigned to the United States as a Soviet who had defected in Helsinki could personally identify Source.
