Austin Horn, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) advised the Liaison Agent on August 30, 1963, that a reliable CIA source in Madrid, Spain, had been in contact with the American students who accompanied the group which recently visited Cuba. This contact took place on August 27, 1963, at which time [Tischman] volunteered the following information to the CIA source: [Tischman] identified the following students as fellow travelers: Joseph Rex, Elena B. Fleming, John Milton, Don Rahmann, and Albert [Maher]. [Tischman] referred to Levi [Laud] as a "communist in ideology" but not a Party member. He stated that Philip [A] [Tischman] is a Trotskyite; that John W. Thomas is a decided partisan of the policy of Mao Tse Tung; that Eric D. [Johnston] is "of communist ideology though not a Party member"; that Clinton [Jenkins] is "the son of the number three ranking communist in California"; and that the only student in the group who is actually a member of the Party is Allan [Sheffield].
